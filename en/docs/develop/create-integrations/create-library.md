# Create a library

A library is a reusable package of shared logic — utility functions, type definitions, data mappers, and connections — that you can use across multiple integrations. Instead of duplicating common code in each integration, create a library once and import it wherever needed.

## Open the creation wizard

On the WSO2 Integrator home screen, click **More Actions** to reveal additional options.

Click **Create Library** to open the library creation wizard.

## Configure the library

The creation wizard prompts you to provide the basic details for your library.

![Create Library form](/img/create-library/create-library-form.png)

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Library Name** | A descriptive name for your library (e.g., `common-utils`). |
| **Project Name** | The name of the project that contains this library. |
| **Create within a project** | Enabled by default. Creates a project workspace that can hold multiple integrations and libraries in a single repository. Uncheck this to create a standalone library. |
| **Select Path** | The directory where the library files are created. Click **Browse** to choose a folder. The full path preview appears below the field. |

Fill in the required fields and click **Create Library**.

WSO2 Integrator generates the library project and opens the [library view](../project-views/library-view.md). The file structure for a library within a project contains a root `Ballerina.toml` and a subdirectory for the library package:

```
project-name/
├── .choreo/
├── .vscode/
├── library-name/
│   ├── .vscode/
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── agents.bal
│   ├── Ballerina.toml
│   ├── config.bal
│   ├── connections.bal
│   ├── data_mappings.bal
│   ├── functions.bal
│   ├── lib.bal
│   └── types.bal
└── Ballerina.toml
```

Note that a library package includes a `lib.bal` file instead of `main.bal`, since libraries expose shared logic rather than executable entry points.

:::tip
You can add integrations to the same project by clicking the **+** button in the WSO2 Integrator sidebar. This lets you build integrations that consume your library within a single project workspace.

## Advanced configurations

Expand the **Advanced Configurations** section to customize the project and Ballerina package settings.

### Project

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Organization Name** | The organization that owns this project. Click **Sign In** to pick from your registered organizations. |
| **Project ID** | A unique identifier for your project used in various contexts. |

### Ballerina package

The library is generated as a Ballerina package. Use these fields to configure the package metadata.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Package Name** | The Ballerina package name. Defaults to the library name. |
| **Package Version** | The initial version of the package. Defaults to `0.1.0`. |
