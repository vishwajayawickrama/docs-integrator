# Chunkers

A **Chunker** splits a document into smaller pieces before they are embedded. Smaller chunks improve retrieval precision but lose surrounding context; larger chunks preserve context but are less precise.

> Most projects start with the default (`AUTO`) and only configure a chunker explicitly when retrieval quality drops because chunks are too big or too small for the content.

## Public Actions

A chunker exposes one action.

| Action | What it does | Required parameters |
|---|---|---|
| **Chunk** | Splits a document into chunks according to the chunker's strategy. | **Document** (the input document). |

You don't usually call this directly — the Knowledge Base calls it for you on **Ingest**.

## `AUTO` and `DISABLE`

You almost always pick one of these in the **Vector Knowledge Base** form's **Chunker** field — only switch to a custom chunker when the defaults aren't producing useful chunks.

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| **AUTO** *(default)* | The Knowledge Base picks a chunker automatically based on document type — Markdown chunker for `.md`, HTML chunker for `.html`, Generic Recursive otherwise. |
| **DISABLE** | No chunking. Each document is treated as a single chunk. Use when documents are already small or pre-chunked. |

## Where To Find Chunkers

Inside the **Create Vector Knowledge Base** form click **+ Create New Chunker**. The **Select Chunker** picker shows the available types:

Provides functionality to recursively chunk a text), Markdown Chunker (Represents a Markdown document chunker. Provides functionality to recursively chunk a Markdown document), and Html Chunker (Represents an HTML document chunker. Provides functionality to recursively chunk a HTML document).](/img/genai/develop/components/chunkers/01-select-list.png)

## Implementations at a Glance

All three local chunkers ship in the core `ballerina/ai` package. The Devant Chunker is a remote implementation that delegates the work to the WSO2 Devant AI service.

| Chunker | Module | Default strategy | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Generic Recursive** | `ballerina/ai` | `PARAGRAPH` | Plain text. Falls back through paragraph → sentence → word → character. |
| **Markdown** | `ballerina/ai` | `MARKDOWN_HEADER` | Markdown documents — splits on headings first, falls back through code-block, paragraph, line, sentence, word, character. |
| **HTML** | `ballerina/ai` | `HTML_HEADER` | HTML documents — splits on `<h1>`–`<h6>`, falls back through `<p>`, `<br>`, sentence, word, character. |
| **Devant** | [`ballerinax/ai.devant`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/ai.devant/latest) | `RECURSIVE` | Binary documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX). Delegates to the Devant AI service. |

> All four chunkers share the same two top-level parameters: **Max Chunk Size** (the cap, in characters, per chunk) and **Max Overlap Size** (characters reused at the boundary between adjacent chunks for context continuity). The local chunkers default to `200` and `40`; the Devant chunker defaults to `500` and `50`.

## Generic Recursive Chunker

For plain text. Begins splitting using the chosen strategy and recursively falls back to finer-grained units when a chunk would exceed the size limit.

### Init form

![Create Chunker form for Generic Recursive showing the banner 'This operation has no required parameters. Optional settings can be configured below.' Advanced Configurations Expand link, Chunker Name aiGenericrecursivechunker, Result Type ai:GenericRecursiveChunker.](/img/genai/develop/components/chunkers/generic-recursive-basic.png)

No required fields — sensible defaults work for most prose.

### Advanced configurations

![Generic Recursive Chunker Create form with Advanced Configurations expanded showing Max Chunk Size (default 200), Max Overlap Size (default 40), Strategy (default PARAGRAPH).](/img/genai/develop/components/chunkers/generic-recursive-advanced.png)

| Field | Default | Available values | What it controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Max Chunk Size** | `200` | Any positive integer (characters) | Maximum characters allowed per chunk. |
| **Max Overlap Size** | `40` | Any non-negative integer (characters) | Characters reused from the end of the previous chunk when starting the next. The overlap is whole sentences taken in reverse, capped at this length, to preserve cross-boundary context. |
| **Strategy** | `PARAGRAPH` | `PARAGRAPH`, `LINE`, `SENTENCE`, `WORD`, `CHARACTER` | Starting splitting unit. The chunker falls back through finer units automatically when a chunk overflows. |

#### Strategy fall-back order

Strategies are tried from large unit to small. If a chunk would exceed Max Chunk Size, the chunker falls back to the next finer strategy.

| Strategy | Boundary | Falls back to |
|---|---|---|
| `PARAGRAPH` | Two or more newlines (`\n\n`). | `SENTENCE` → `WORD` → `CHARACTER` |
| `LINE` | One or more newlines (`\n`). | `WORD` → `CHARACTER` |
| `SENTENCE` | OpenNLP sentence detector. | `WORD` → `CHARACTER` |
| `WORD` | One or more spaces. | `CHARACTER` |
| `CHARACTER` | Individual characters. | (terminal) |

## Markdown Chunker

Header-aware chunker for Markdown. Starts at heading level `##` and walks down before falling back to structure-aware then character-level strategies.

### Init form

![Create Chunker form for Markdown showing the banner 'This operation has no required parameters. Optional settings can be configured below.' Advanced Configurations Expand link, Chunker Name aiMarkdownchunker, Result Type ai:MarkdownChunker.](/img/genai/develop/components/chunkers/markdown-basic.png)

No required fields.

### Advanced configurations

![Markdown Chunker Create form with Advanced Configurations expanded showing Max Chunk Size (default 200), Max Overlap Size (default 40), Strategy (default MARKDOWN_HEADER).](/img/genai/develop/components/chunkers/markdown-advanced.png)

| Field | Default | Available values | What it controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Max Chunk Size** | `200` | Any positive integer | Max characters per chunk. |
| **Max Overlap Size** | `40` | Any non-negative integer | Overlap characters between adjacent chunks. |
| **Strategy** | `MARKDOWN_HEADER` | `MARKDOWN_HEADER`, `CODE_BLOCK`, `HORIZONTAL_LINE`, `PARAGRAPH`, `LINE`, `SENTENCE`, `WORD`, `CHARACTER` | Starting splitting unit. |

#### Strategy options

| Strategy | What it splits on |
|---|---|
| `MARKDOWN_HEADER` | Markdown headers, starting at `##` and walking down to `######`. Falls back through `CODE_BLOCK`, `HORIZONTAL_LINE`, `PARAGRAPH`, `LINE`, `SENTENCE`, `WORD`, `CHARACTER`. |
| `CODE_BLOCK` | Fenced code blocks. Each becomes a chunk tagged with type `code_block` (and a `language` annotation if declared). Code-block chunks are never merged with neighbours. |
| `HORIZONTAL_LINE` | The patterns `***`, `---`, `___`. Falls back to `PARAGRAPH`. |
| `PARAGRAPH` / `LINE` / `SENTENCE` / `WORD` / `CHARACTER` | Same semantics as the Generic Recursive Chunker. |

## Devant Chunker

A remote chunker that delegates the actual splitting to the WSO2 Devant AI service. Useful when you have **binary** documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX) that the local chunkers can't read directly. Pair it with the Devant Binary Data Loader to read the file as a binary document. Official: [WSO2 Devant](https://wso2.com/devant/).

### Init form

The Devant Chunker is added from the same **Select Chunker** picker. Its create form requires connecting to the Devant service.

| Field | Required | Default | Available values |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Service URL** | Yes | — | The Devant AI service endpoint URL. |
| **Access Token** | Yes | — | Access token for authenticating with the Devant service. |

### Advanced configurations

| Field | Default | Available values | What it controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Maximum Chunk Size in Characters** | `500` | Any positive integer | Max characters per chunk. |
| **Maximum Overlap Size in Characters** | `50` | Any non-negative integer | Overlap characters between adjacent chunks. |
| **Chunking Strategy** | `RECURSIVE` | `RECURSIVE`, `SENTENCE`, `PARAGRAPH`, `CHARACTER` | The strategy Devant should use. |

Plus the [Standard HTTP Advanced Configurations](/docs/genai/develop/components/model-providers#standard-http-advanced-configurations).

> Only binary documents are accepted. The document's metadata must include a file name so Devant can detect the source format.

## Picking a Chunk Size

Chunk size is the most-tuned knob in RAG. Some rules of thumb:

| Symptom | Try |
|---|---|
| Retrieval brings back the right doc but the wrong section. | **Smaller** Max Chunk Size (try 150). |
| Retrieved chunks lose context (an answer is cut off mid-thought). | **Larger** Max Chunk Size (try 400) or **larger** Max Overlap Size. |
| Many tiny low-relevance results crowding out the good one. | **Larger** Max Chunk Size. |
| Retrieval cost is high (many calls, slow queries). | **Larger** Max Chunk Size, fewer chunks per document. |

The defaults (`200` / `40`) are tuned for prose. Code-heavy or table-heavy content usually wants larger chunks.
