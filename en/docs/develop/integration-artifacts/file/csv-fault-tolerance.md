# CSV Fault Tolerance

Real-world CSV files rarely arrive perfectly clean. A single bad row — a stray comma, a wrong data type, a trailing blank — would normally fail the whole file. With **CSV fault tolerance** enabled, the listener treats malformed rows as a per-row issue instead of a per-file one. It skips rows that don't fit your schema and hands the rest to the handler as if nothing happened.

## What the handler sees

| Feature state | Bad row encountered | Handler receives | File outcome (default) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Off** (default) | The first malformed row trips data binding | An `error` instead of content | Moves to the **After Error** destination |
| **On** | The row is dropped before the handler is called | Only valid rows, as usual | Moves to the **After Success** destination |

:::note[Fault tolerance needs a typed row schema]
Fault tolerance only skips rows that fail **typed binding**. If your handler is generated with the default `string[][]` content type, every row is valid as a string array and nothing is ever dropped.

On the **Add File Handler** form, click **+ Define Row Schema** and describe each column as a field on a Ballerina record. This flips the handler parameter to a typed array (for example `Order[]`), and rows that don't match trigger binding errors that fault tolerance can skip. See the [row-schema step in Streaming large files](streaming-large-files.md#enabling-streaming) for a walkthrough.
:::

Fault tolerance combines cleanly with:

- **Streaming** — works with [streamed CSV](streaming-large-files.md). A bad row no longer terminates the stream; processing continues through the rest of the file.
- **Move / Delete post-processing** — because the handler completes successfully, the file follows the **After Success** action as it would for a clean run.

## Configuration

Fault tolerance is a **listener-level** setting. Turn it on once per listener and every CSV handler attached to that service inherits the behaviour. It is part of the listener's regular configuration, not tucked under Advanced.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ui" label="Visual Designer" default>

1. Open the listener by clicking its name under **Listeners** in the sidebar, or under **Attached Listeners** in the **FTP Integration Configuration** panel.
2. Scroll to the **Csv Fail Safe** field and click **Record** to open the builder.
3. In the side **Record Configuration** panel, tick the top-level **FailSafeOptions** checkbox to include the record, tick **contentType**, and pick an enum value:

   | `contentType` value | What gets logged for a dropped row |
   |---|---|
   | **METADATA** *(default)* | Row number, column, and the binding error. |
   | **RAW** | The raw row text as it appeared in the source file. |
   | **RAW_AND_METADATA** | Both. |

4. Close the side panel and click **Save**. Every CSV handler on every service attached to this listener now skips malformed rows.

Add a `csvFailSafe` field to the listener constructor:

```ballerina
import ballerina/ftp;

listener ftp:Listener ftpListener = new (
    protocol = ftp:FTP,
    host = "ftp.example.com",
    port = 21,
    auth = {credentials: {username: ftpUser, password: ftpPassword}},
    csvFailSafe = {
        contentType: ftp:RAW_AND_METADATA
    }
);

@ftp:ServiceConfig { path: "/incoming" }
service on ftpListener {
    remote function onFileCsv(Order[] orders, ftp:FileInfo fileInfo) returns error? {
        // `orders` contains only rows that parsed successfully.
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Dropped-row log

When fault tolerance is on, the listener writes each dropped row to a side log file. The filename is the source CSV's basename with its extension replaced by `_error.log`, and the file is created in the integration's working directory:

```text
incoming/orders-2026.csv   →   <working-dir>/orders-2026_error.log
```

Each dropped row becomes one JSON line. The `contentType` setting picked above controls which fields appear:

| `contentType` value | `time` | `location.{row,column}` | `offendingRow` | `message` |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `METADATA` *(default)* | &check; | &check; | — | &check; |
| `RAW` | &check; | &check; | &check; | — |
| `RAW_AND_METADATA` | &check; | &check; | &check; | &check; |

Example entry with `RAW_AND_METADATA`:

```json
{"time":"2026-04-19T05:17:27.239Z","location":{"row":3,"column":3},"offendingRow":"2,sprocket,five,4.75","message":"value 'five' cannot be cast into 'int'"}
```

The file is opened in **append** mode, so repeated drops for files whose names share a prefix accumulate in the same log.

The `_error.log` filename, location, and JSON layout are the built-in defaults for the `onFileCsv` handler. If you need a different file name, a different directory, or a custom log format, switch to an `onFileText` handler and parse the CSV yourself with `csv:parseString` — you control every aspect of error handling from there. See [CSV & Flat File Processing](../transform/csv-flat-file.md) for the parser reference and the handler pattern.

## Routing files with dropped rows

:::note[Dropped rows don't flip the file to After Error]
The listener's **After Success** and **After Error** branches are picked based on whether the handler returned an error. A dropped row is not itself an error — even if every row in the file gets dropped, the handler still receives an empty typed array and the file takes the **After Success** path by default.
:::

If your flow needs a file with dropped rows to go to the error directory instead, the handler has to detect the condition and route the file explicitly. The reliable signal is the presence of the `_error.log` side file described above.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ui" label="Visual Designer" default>

1. On the **Add File Handler** form, open **Advanced Parameters** and tick **FTP Connection (caller)**. The handler now receives an extra `ftp:Caller` argument you can use to move the file programmatically.
2. In the handler flow, add an **If** node that branches on `orders.length() == 0`.
3. In the `true` branch, add an **Action** node to call `file:test` for `<prefix>_error.log`. When the log exists, either:

   - add a **Return** node that returns an `error(...)` — this fires **After Error** and moves the original via the listener's configured `/error` destination; or
   - call `caller->rename(fileInfo.path, "/error/" + fileInfo.name)` and return `()` — useful when you want the handler, not the listener, to pick the destination.

4. Leave the `false` branch to process the valid rows.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="code" label="Ballerina Code">

```ballerina
import ballerina/file;
import ballerina/ftp;

remote function onFileCsv(Order[] orders, ftp:FileInfo fileInfo, ftp:Caller caller) returns error? {
    if orders.length() > 0 {
        // Valid rows present — process normally.
        return;
    }

    string name = fileInfo.name;
    int? dot = name.lastIndexOf(".");
    string prefix = dot is int ? name.substring(0, dot) : name;

    if check file:test(prefix + "_error.log", file:EXISTS) {
        // Every row was dropped by fault tolerance.
        return error("all CSV rows were dropped", path = fileInfo.path);
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The simpler alternative is to leave fault tolerance **off** entirely. The first bad row then trips data binding, the handler receives an `error`, and the file takes the **After Error** branch with no custom code.

## When to leave it off

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Partner agreement says every row must be accounted for | Leave fault tolerance **off**. A single bad row should fail the file and route it to the error directory for replay. |
| The feed is known-dirty and most rows are usable | Turn it **on**. Clean rows proceed and dropped rows are logged. |
| You need files with any dropped rows to go to **After Error** | Leave fault tolerance **off**, or add the dropped-row check shown in [Routing files with dropped rows](#routing-files-with-dropped-rows). |
| You need a different log format, filename, or location | Switch to `onFileText` and parse with [`csv:parseString`](../transform/csv-flat-file.md). |
