# High Availability and Coordination

When you deploy several copies of the same FTP/SFTP integration — for example, one per pod in a Kubernetes cluster — every copy would normally connect to the same remote directory and pick up every file. That causes duplicate processing, race conditions, and inconsistent downstream state.

Turning on **Coordination** fixes this. One copy is elected as the active node and polls the server; the others stay as warm standbys and take over automatically if the active one goes down. You only need one extra thing — a shared database the nodes use to elect a leader and exchange heartbeats.

## How it works

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Leader election** | On startup, every copy in the same `coordinationGroup` registers with the shared database. One copy is elected active. |
| **2. Heartbeat** | Every node in the group — active and standby — writes its own heartbeat row at the `heartbeatFrequency` interval. This advertises liveness so any node can be promoted when needed. |
| **3. Liveness check** | Standby nodes periodically check the active node's heartbeat. If the heartbeat goes stale, the active node is considered dead. |
| **4. Failover** | A standby is promoted to active and starts polling immediately — no manual intervention. |
| **5. Polling behaviour** | Only the active node polls the FTP server. Standby nodes skip polling entirely, consuming no FTP server resources. |

The pattern is **active-passive**: at most one node polls at a time. Per-file locking across multiple active pollers isn't supported.

## Enabling coordination

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ui" label="Visual Designer" default>

1. Open the listener by clicking its name under **Listeners** in the sidebar, or under **Attached Listeners** in the **FTP Integration Configuration** panel.
2. Scroll to the **Coordination** field and click **Record** to open the builder.
3. Fill in the three required fields:

   | Field | What to enter |
   |---|---|
   | **Member Id** | A unique name for this copy of the integration. Every pod/instance must have a different value. Typically sourced from a `configurable` so each deployment can set its own. |
   | **Coordination Group** | A shared name that all copies of the same listener use. Copies with matching group names coordinate; copies with different group names are independent. |
   | **Database Config** | Connection details (host, port, user, password, database) for the shared MySQL or PostgreSQL database used to track leader election. |

4. Save the listener. Deploy each copy with a different **Member Id**.

Add a `coordination` record to the `ftp:Listener` configuration. Source `memberId` from a `configurable` so each deployment sets its own value; keep `coordinationGroup` identical across copies you want to coordinate.

```ballerina
import ballerina/ftp;
import ballerina/task;
// The driver import is required at runtime even though it isn't referenced
// directly. Use `ballerinax/postgresql.driver as _` for PostgreSQL.
import ballerinax/mysql.driver as _;

configurable string memberId = ?;

listener ftp:Listener ftpListener = new ({
    host: "ftp.example.com",
    port: 21,
    auth: {credentials: {username: "user", password: "pass"}},
    pollingInterval: 30,
    coordination: {
        databaseConfig: <task:MysqlConfig>{
            host: "mysql.example.com",
            user: "coordinator",
            password: "secret",
            database: "ftp_coordination"
        },
        memberId: memberId,
        coordinationGroup: "incoming-files-group"
    }
});

service on ftpListener {
    remote function onFileText(string content, ftp:FileInfo fileInfo) returns error? {
        // Only one copy in the cluster executes this handler per file.
    }
}
```

`ftp:CoordinationConfig` fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `databaseConfig` | `task:DatabaseConfig` | — | Connection details for the coordination database. Accepts `MysqlConfig` or `PostgresqlConfig`. Required. |
| `memberId` | `string` | — | Unique identifier for this node. Must be distinct across all nodes in the coordination group. Required. |
| `coordinationGroup` | `string` | — | Name of the coordination group. All listeners with the same group coordinate together. Required. |
| `livenessCheckInterval` | `int` | `30` | Seconds between heartbeat checks by standby nodes. |
| `heartbeatFrequency` | `int` | `1` | Seconds between heartbeat writes by the active node. |

### Database schema

Create the coordination tables in your MySQL or PostgreSQL database **before starting the first instance** — the runtime does not create them for you. Both dialects are supported; use whichever your ops team already runs.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="mysql" label="MySQL" default>

```sql
CREATE TABLE token_holder (
    group_id   VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    task_id    VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    term       BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);

CREATE TABLE health_check (
    task_id        VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    group_id       VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    last_heartbeat DATETIME NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (task_id, group_id)
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="postgres" label="PostgreSQL">

```sql
CREATE TABLE token_holder (
    group_id   VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    task_id    VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    term       BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);

CREATE TABLE health_check (
    task_id        VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    group_id       VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    last_heartbeat TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (task_id, group_id)
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Every node in a `coordinationGroup` shares the same two tables. The runtime writes heartbeats to `health_check`, elects a leader by upserting `token_holder`, and compares `last_heartbeat` against the database's own `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for liveness. You don't need to pre-seed any rows — creating the tables is enough.

### Database availability

Coordination depends on the shared database being reachable. If the database goes down:

- The **active node** stops polling — its heartbeat writes fail, and file dispatch halts until the database comes back. Files that arrive on the FTP server during the outage are processed only after the database is restored and polling resumes.
- **Standby nodes** also cannot take over until the database is reachable again. On recovery, a standby promotes itself within one liveness-check interval and begins polling.

Treat the coordination database as critical infrastructure on the data path: plan replicas, backups, and failover to the same standard as your FTP/SFTP source.
