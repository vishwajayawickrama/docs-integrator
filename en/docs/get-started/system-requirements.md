Before you install WSO2 Integrator, make sure your development environment meets these requirements.

## Hardware requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Processor** | 0.2 core (1.0--1.2 GHz) | 1+ core |
| **Memory (Heap)** | 512 MB | 1 GB+ |
| **Disk Space** | 2 GB free | 5+ GB free |

## Supported operating systems

| **Ubuntu** | 24.04 LTS |
| **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** | RHEL 9 |
| **macOS** | macOS 14.6 (Sonoma) or later |

## ARM compatibility

WSO2 Integrator is compatible with ARM processors. It can run on ARM-based systems, such as those with Apple Silicon or ARM-based Linux distributions.

### Supported Java distributions

A compatible JRE version will be automatically installed during the WSO2 Integrator installation process.
Any JRE 21 distribution works. Tested distributions:

| Distribution | Version |
|---|---|
| Amazon Corretto JRE | 21 |
| Eclipse Adoptium (Temurin) JRE | 21 |
| OpenJRE | 21 |
| Oracle JRE | 21 |

### Java setup

Install a supported JDK/JRE:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install openjdk@21

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk

# Windows (winget)
winget install Microsoft.OpenJDK.21
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
java -version
```

Set `JAVA_HOME` if it's not already configured:

```bash
# macOS
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21)

# Linux
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64
```
## Network requirements

The development environment needs internet access for:

- Downloading the WSO2 Integrator and updates
- Pulling packages from [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io)

If you're behind a corporate proxy, configure proxy settings in VS Code and in your terminal environment.
