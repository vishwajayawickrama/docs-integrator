# Automation

Automations run without an external request. Use them for scheduled data sync, batch processing, report generation, and other recurring tasks that need to execute on a timer or on demand.

## Creating an automation

In the WSO2 Integrator sidebar, click **+** next to **Automations**. The automation creation form opens.

Fill in the following fields:

- **Name** — enter a name for the automation. This is used as the function name in the generated code.
- **Schedule** — choose between a **Scheduled** (runs on a recurring interval) or **Manual** (triggered on demand) execution type.

Click **Create** to generate the automation.

## Designing the automation

After creation, WSO2 Integrator opens the automation in the flow designer. Use the design view to build your automation logic by adding actions, connections, and control flow.

<!-- TODO: add screenshot — Design view of a newly created automation -->

To update the schedule or change the execution type after creation, click **Configure** in the design view toolbar. This reopens the configuration panel where you can edit the automation settings.

## Generated code

WSO2 Integrator creates an `automation.bal` file in your project with the following starter structure:

```ballerina
import ballerina/log;

public function main() returns error? {
    do {
    } on fail error e {
        log:printError("Error occurred", 'error = e);
        return e;
    }
}
```

Add your integration logic inside the `do` block. The `on fail` block handles any errors that occur during execution.
