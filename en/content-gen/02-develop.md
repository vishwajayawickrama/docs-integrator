# Section 6: Develop

**Question this section answers:** "How do I build, transform, and test X?"

**Audience:** Developer actively building integrations. Has completed Get Started. Knows basic Ballerina syntax or is using low-code designer.

**Tone:** Practical, task-oriented, handbook-style. 3-minute reads with specific answers. NOT tutorials (those go in Section 9).

**Boundary rule:** Everything while code is on your machine. AI-assisted dev (Copilot) stays here. AI-powered integrations (agents, RAG, MCP) → GenAI.
